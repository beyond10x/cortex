# Acknowledged specification changes

`task compat` compares `spec/` with `spec/` at the newest release tag (`ess verify diff
--fail-on breaking-or-unknown`) and fails on a breaking or unknown change that
[`compat-ack.json`](compat-ack.json) does not acknowledge. That file is ESS's
`ess-diff-acknowledgements/1`: the change ids, bound to the spec digests of both sides, and no
reasons. Each acknowledged change has its reason here, one row each; `tests/compat_ack.rs` fails
when an id has no row or a row no id.

The comparison: `v0.7.0` against the release being prepared. After a release, both files are
reset (AGENTS.md, "The specification comes first").
