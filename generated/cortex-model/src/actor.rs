//! A grant is checked against a caller identity, which these types do not read from anywhere:
//! whatever authenticates a request builds a [`Caller`], and a served surface checks it against
//! [`may`] before the command runs. The `PLAN.md` beside this workspace says, per actor,
//! whether a generated surface enforces the grant or the caller does.
